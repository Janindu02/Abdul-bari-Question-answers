# Abdul-bari-Question-answers
This repository contains my solutions and practice work for questions and exercises from the "Java Programming" course by Abdul Bari on Udemy. The course covers essential Java concepts, ranging from basics to advanced topics, and this repository serves as a collection of code examples and problem-solving approaches I've implemented during the learning process.
Topics Covered:

    Core Java Fundamentals (Variables, Data Types, Control Flow)
    Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation)
    Data Structures in Java (Arrays, Collections, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)
    Exception Handling
    File I/O and Streams
    Multithreading
    Recursion and Problem Solving

Purpose:

    Self-Learning: Reinforce Java concepts through hands-on practice.
    Reference: A go-to guide for revisiting solutions and understanding different Java programming techniques.
    Sharing Knowledge: Helping other learners by providing clear and well-documented solutions.
